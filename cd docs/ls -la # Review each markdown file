1. Relational Database Schema
File: docs/DATA-MODEL-Relational.md

This includes:

✅ 45+ tables with complete SQL definitions
✅ PostgreSQL/ZeroDB optimized schemas
✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
✅ Encryption strategy for sensitive data
✅ Indexes and performance optimizations
✅ Foreign key relationships
✅ Check constraints and validations
✅ Materialized views for analytics
✅ Partitioning recommendations
Key table groups:

User Management (users, user_roles, user_preferences, user_grief_profiles)
Social Integration (social_accounts, social_contacts, data_sync_logs)
AI & Matching (ai_conversations, ai_messages, ai_introductions)
Community (connections, messages, support_groups, group_members, group_posts)
Funeral Planning (funeral_plans, planning_tasks, planning_expenses, planning_documents)
Memorial & Legacy (memorials, memorial_tributes, memorial_media, virtual_candles, legacy_content)
Professional Services (professional_profiles, service_listings, bookings, reviews)
Support Resources (resources, user_resource_interactions, mood_journal, crisis_interventions)
2. Vector Database Schema
File: docs/DATA-MODEL-Vector.md

This includes:

✅ 6 vector collections with complete specifications
✅ Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant configurations
✅ 1536-dimension embeddings (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large)
✅ Metadata schemas for filtering
✅ Query examples and use cases
✅ Embedding generation pipelines
✅ Hybrid search strategies
✅ Cost optimization techniques
✅ Performance tuning
Vector collections:

user_embeddings (for semantic matching)
grief_story_embeddings (for narrative similarity)
resource_embeddings (for content recommendations)
conversation_embeddings (for AI context)
professional_service_embeddings (for provider matching)
memorial_embeddings (for discovery)
🔍 Would you like me to create something additional?
I can generate:

Visual ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship diagram using Mermaid)
Database Migration Files (Prisma or Alembic format)
Sample SQL Insert Statements (seed data)
GraphQL Schema (if you prefer GraphQL over REST)
TypeScript Type Definitions (from database schema)
API Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
More detailed examples for specific tables
Or would you like me to:

Explain specific parts of the existing schemas?
Create a simplified version?
Add additional tables for specific features?
Show you how the relational and vector models work together?
Let me know what would be most helpfu
